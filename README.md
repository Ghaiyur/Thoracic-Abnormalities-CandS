When you have a broken arm, radiologists help save the dayâ€”and the bone. These doctors diagnose and treat medical conditions using imaging techniques like CT and PET scans, MRIs, and, of course, X-rays. Yet, as it happens when working with such a wide variety of medical tools, radiologists face many daily challenges, perhaps the most difficult being the chest radiograph.

Computer-aided detection and diagnosis systems (CADe/CADx) would help reduce the pressure on doctors at metropolitan hospitals and improve diagnostic quality in rural areas.
